# README  - ermahgerd-rails-api-cognito
         
The Rails API server for the Ermahgerd Demo.  Serves up JSONAPI payloads, conveniently 
consumed by an EmberJs Single Page Application using Ember-Data.

The EmberJs demo application that talks to this API is found at:
[https://github.com/cybertooth-io/ermahgerd-emberjs-cognito](https://github.com/cybertooth-io/ermahgerd-emberjs-cognito)

## Development - Getting Started

You need the following:

* Ruby-2.6.x Make sure your production environment matches (e.g. Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk)
* Docker - we use two containers, one for the PostgreSQL database and one for Redis
* A `config/master.key` file that we've given you or generate your own along with your _credentials_ (see below)

### First Time Setting Up

Perform the following from the command line:

1. Create your config/credentials.yml.enc file (see _No Secrets Here - Credentials Instead_ section below).
1. `bundle install` - will install any of the missing gems declared in the `Gemfile`
1. `docker-compose up -d` - start up a Redis and PostgreSQL server in a container
1. `rake db:create` - only required the first time, make sure your database is created
1. `rake db:migrate` - run as required, your application will produce a stacktrace of errors if you're not up to date
1. `rake db:seed_fu` - run as required, to seed the database with data
1. `rake test` - run as required, test to make sure your API is behaving

### Running The Server

`rails s` - to serve the API on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Database Seeds

Seed the database with:

```bash
$ rake db:seed_fu
```

#### Seeding Administrator Users

You need to create at least one Administrator in both this database and the corresponding user over in
AWS Cognito.

1. Feel free to edit the `db/fixtures/development/002_users.rb` file to a new user to the database
1. Sign in to AWS Web Console and create a user in your pool that shares the same email address

_Once one administrator has been created, you can create new users inside this app._

### Redis

Redis is used by Sidekiq to queue up jobs.

Sidekiq is configured in `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb` to use database `0`.

### Crons/Jobs/Queues

If you're creating Sidekiq jobs please use the generator: `rails g sidekiq:worker record_session_activity`

### Development Workflow

1. Create a model with its **singular name**: `rails g model role key:string name:string notes:text`
    1. Edit the migration to ensure the `default` and `null` values are defined
    1. Add auto_strip_attributes, validations, relationships, scopes, etc. to the new model class
        * Make sure to declare your relationships on the inverse model as needed.
    1. Is the model audited?  Yes, then add the `audited` declaration to the model class
    1. Add test fixture data accordingly to `test/fixtures/*.yml` (keep it general and un-crazy)
    1. Define any scopes that you may require
    1. Unit test accordingly
    1. Add the model information to the `config/locales/*.yml` file(s)
1. Create the pundit policy with the **model's singular name**: `rails g pundit:policy role`
    1. Make sure your policy file extends `ApplicationPolicy` (it should by default)
    1. Override `create?`, `destroy?`, `index?`, `show?`, and `update?` accordingly
    1. Unit test accordingly
    1. Add the policy error messages to the `config/locales/*.yml` if so desired
1. Create the protected resource using the **model's singular name** at the appropriate api path: 
`rails g jsonapi:resource api/v1/protected/role`
    1. Make sure the resource extends `BaseResource`
    1. Add the appropriate attributes from the model that will be serialized in the JSONAPI payload
    1. Make sure all relationships you want exposed are added
        * Make sure to declare your relationships on the inverse model as needed.
    1. Add any filters that use model scopes
    1. Unit test accordingly through the controller (next step)
1. Create the protected controller using the **model's plural name** at the appropriate api path:
`rails g controller api/v1/protected/roles`
    1. Make sure the controller extends `BaseResourceController`
    1. Add the controller's end points to the `config/routes.rb` file; use `jsonapi_resources` helper :-)
    1. Unit test accordingly (e.g. confirm returned payload only contains the fields specified in the resource)

### Commiting Code

1. Use a branch and a pull request into master.
1. Run `rubocop -a` prior to commits to make sure your code conforms to the formatting and linting.

## Configuration Notes

The `config/initializers/ermahgerd.rb` can be used to override a number of configuration options.

The Configuration options are set to their defaults in `lib/ermahgerd/configuration.rb`; check out the
initialize method.

## No Secrets Here - Credentials Instead

As of Rails-5.2 secrets are hashed and locked down with the `config/master.key` file.  Run 
`rails credentials:help` for more information.

This application ships with an already created `config/credentials.yml.enc` and 
we share the `master.key` amongst ourselves ... but not with Joe Public (or Josephine Public).

If you're forking this or trying it yourself, you'll want to:

1. `rm config/credentials.yml.enc` to get rid of the current credentials
1. `rails credentials:edit` to begin editing your credentials file
1. Add the keys that are described in the section below.  Please leverage
the `rake secret` tool to create your keys that you're placing into your credentials file.

### Keys in `config/credentials.yml.enc`

```bash
$ rails credentials:edit  # you might have to destroy the existing `config/credentials.yml.enc` if this command fails
```

#### Example File Contents

```yaml
# AWS client credentials for S3, Cognito, etc.
aws:
  access_key_id: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  secret_access_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  region: xx-region-x
  cognito:
    # Used by operations of the Aws::CognitoIdentityProvider::Client; 
    # the Pool ID (found in the Cognito web console)
    user_pool_id: xx-region-x_abcdefghi
    # the CLIENT ID (there could be multiple, we may need to refactor this into an array)
    client_id: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

# Used as the base secret for all MessageVerifiers in Rails, including the one protecting cookies.
secret_key_base: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 
# the jwk_set from AWS Cognito: see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-verifying-a-jwt.html#amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-step-2
jwk_set: '...'

# the token's AUDience that is verified during authentication; also known as the App Client ID (check out Cognito web console)
token_aud: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# the token's ISSuer url; again verified during authentication
token_iss: https://cognito-idp.xx-region-x.amazonaws.com/xx-region-x_xxxxxxxxx
```

#### Keys Explained

`aws:access_key_id` - the access key used to interface with S3, Cognito, etc.

`aws:secret_access_key` - the secret access key used to interface with S3, Cognito, etc.

`aws:region` - the default region that all AWS Client connections will be directed to.

`aws:cognito:user_pool_id` - this is your AWS Cognito's User Pool Id; looks something like: `xx-region-x_abcdefghi`

`aws:cognito:client_id` - this your AWS Cognito's Client Id, it's 26 characters long: 
e.g. `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`.  **There's a possibility that your pool has multiple clients
interacting with this API, server as such this key may need to be refactored.** 

`secret_key_base` - used by most Rails apps in one way or another (e.g. BCrypt).  Please set this to a
strong key; all environments (development, test, etc.) require this to be set.

`jwk_set` - the set of JWK from Cognito that will be used to decode supplied Authorization tokens.  Yours will be found
at `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{userPoolId}/.well-known/jwks.json`.  
Check out the Cognito docs: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-verifying-a-jwt.html#amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-step-2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-verifying-a-jwt.html#amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-step-2)
By default, the TEST environment of this app does not use this JWK set.  DEVELOPMENT & PRODUCTION do use this unless
you change the configuration through `config/initializers/ermahgerd.rb`.

`token_aud` - name of the audience in your token from Cognito; makes sure not just any Cognito token 
can access this app.  You can get this information from your Cognito configuration or the payloads 
from your authentication requests to Cognito.  By default, the TEST environment of this app does 
not use this setting; it makes up a fake audience value.  DEVELOPMENT & PRODUCTION do use this unless
you change the configuration through `config/initializers/ermahgerd.rb`.

`token_iss` - the url that issued the token.  You can get this information from your Cognito configuration 
or the payloads from your authentication requests to Cognito.  By default, the TEST environment of this app does 
not use this setting; it makes up a fake audience value.  DEVELOPMENT & PRODUCTION do use this unless
you change the configuration through `config/initializers/ermahgerd.rb`.
